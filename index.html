        understand how your information is collected and used.</p>
        <p>This Privacy
        Policy discloses our practices regarding information collection and
        usage solely for our website and services (together, the “Service”).
        This Privacy Policy applies only to the Service and does not govern any
        other websites, applications or services, unless it appears on such
        website, application or service.</p>  <p>  By registering with the Service by
        creating an account or otherwise using or accessing the Service, you
        agree to be bound by our Privacy Policy. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO US USING
        YOUR PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION IN THE MANNER SET OUT IN THIS
        PRIVACY POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT REGISTER FOR AN ACCOUNT OR OTHERWISE USE
        OR ACCESS THE SERVICE.</p> 
      </p>
      <h4>Personally Identifiable Information That We Collect </h4>
      <p>
      We only collect personally identifiable information about you that you specifically and knowingly provide to us. We may collect this information in a variety of ways, including without limitation when you register for an account, create a profile, or enter into an agreement with a user through the Service. 
      </p>
      <p>
      You have the option to register for an account with us by using a third-party social networking site, including Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and YouTube (the “Third Party Sites”). You also have the option to link your account to any such Third Party Sites. We may collect personally identifiable information about you from any such Third Party Sites. We do not control these Third Party Sites and their use is governed by the privacy policies of the Third Party Sites.
    </p>
    <p>
      The personally identifiable information which you provide to us and that we collect on our own or through the Third Party Sites could include, without limitation:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your name, e-mail address, birthday, work history, education history, current city, and telephone number.</li>
        <li>Your account username and password.</li>

        <li>Communications between you and us and between you and other third parties on the Service (e.g., messages and emails).</li>
    </ul>
   <h4> Non-Personally Identifiable Information That We Collect </h4>
   <p>
When you visit the Service, we may automatically collect certain non-identifying information about you, such as the computer operating system or mobile device that you use to access the Service, your Internet Protocol address, your browser type and settings, geographic locations, access times and durations, the domain name of the website from which you arrived to the Service, links that you click on within the Service, any other activity of yours on the Service and other technical information that assists us in improving the Service.
</p>

<h4>Cookies and Similar Technologies </h4>
<p>We may use “cookies” or similar types of technology (e.g., device identifiers, pixels tags, web beacons, clear GIFs, and local storage) to collect information about your use of the Service, such as pages you have visited, content you have viewed, searches you have run and how you have otherwise interacted with the Service. We may use this information for insight and analysis purposes to help us enhance the Service, and make your visit more convenient. For your information, “cookies” are small text files containing a string of characters that can be placed on your computer or mobile device that uniquely identifies your browser or device. Some cookies and similar technologies are essential to the operation of the Service. Some are not essential, but instead allow us to provide additional functionality or to gather additional information about your use of the Service. In addition, we may use third-party analytics tools to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These third parties may employ cookies, device identifiers, or similar technologies. We do not control these third-party technologies and their use is governed by the privacy policies of the third parties using such technologies. Your browser may allow you to control cookies or other types of local data storage, and your mobile device may provide you with information and choices on what data is shared with us.

        </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Please be assured that any credit and/or debit card details and billing address you provide us will only be processed by us and/or shared with a third party strictly in connection with any transactions you enter into on the Service.
We will only retain your personally identifiable information as long as reasonably required to provide you with the Service unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (for example, for regulatory purposes).

</p>

<h4>Disclosure of Your Information </h4>
 <p>We may share your personally identifiable information when we have your consent. We will not disclose your personally identifiable information to third parties without your consent, except as set forth below or provided elsewhere in this Privacy Policy:</p>
<ul>
 <li>We may disclose your personally identifiable information to our vendors, subcontractors, and partners, and other third parties who provide services to us. For instance, if you make a payment on the Service, we may disclose certain of your personally identifiable information to Stripe (our payment processing provider). However, they are only permitted to access your information in connection with performing such services and are not authorized by us to use the information for their own benefit.</li>
<li>We may disclose your personally identifiable information to protect the safety, rights, or property of the public, any person, or Broad Influence; to investigate, prevent, or otherwise address suspected fraud, harassment or other violations of any law, rule or regulation or the Terms of Use for the Service; to detect, prevent or otherwise address security or technical issues; or as we believe is required by law, regulation, or legal process.</li>
<li>We do not sell or rent your personally identifiable information to third parties; provided, however, we may engage in a merger, acquisition, disposition, change of control, bankruptcy, dissolution, reorganization, or similar transaction or proceeding that involves the transfer of your information.</li>
</ul>
<p>We may share non-personally identifiable information or generic aggregated demographic information with our partners or other third parties for any purpose.</p>

<h4>Credit Card Companies</h4>
<p>Credit card transactions related to transactions within the Service may be handled by third party financial institutions and their vendors and contractors who receive credit card numbers and other personal information from us to verify the credit card numbers and process transactions. Although our treatment of this information is governed by this Privacy Policy, the use of your information by the third party financial institutions and their vendors and contractors will be subject to their own privacy policies. </p>
<h4>Security</h4>
<p>The security of your information is very important to us. We attempt to provide for the secure storage of your information by using commercially reasonable safeguards and taking reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting you access to your account. Unfortunately, due to the inherent nature of the Internet and online communications, we cannot ensure the security of any information you transmit to us or guarantee that information on the Service or our servers will be free from unauthorized access by third parties such as hackers. Your use of the Service demonstrates your assumption of this risk. All of our employees, workers and data processors (i.e. those who process your personal data on our behalf), who have access to, and are associated with, the processing of personally identifiable information, are obliged to respect the confidentiality of the personally identifiable information of all users of the Service.</p>
<h4>Other Websites, Applications and Services </h4>
<p>The Service may integrate third-party services and content and may contain links to third-party websites and applications. Functionality on the Service may also permit interactions between the Service and a third-party website or feature. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of these third-party services, websites and applications, and we do not endorse or promote such third-party websites, applications and services. This Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use do not apply to any third-party service, website or application. Your browsing and interaction on any third-party service, website or application or service, including those that are integrated in the App or have a link on the App, are subject to that third party’s own rules and policies. When you link away from our App, you do so at your own risk.</p>
<h4>Data Erasure </h4>
<p>You can also request that we erase any personal data we hold about you. This does not include any data we are obliged to keep for administrative, legal, or security purposes. Please note that your use of the Service may be ineffective upon such erasure.</p>

<h4>User Communication to Us</h4>
<p>Any information you provide to us through feedback, surveys, suggestions, information posted to any public area of the Service (e.g. a forum) any ideas for new products or modifications to existing products, and any other unsolicited submissions without the parts that identify you, will be treated as non-confidential and non-proprietary and we may use it and share it with third parties.</p>
<h4>Protection for Children </h4>
<p>The Terms of Service clearly provide that you must be at least 18 years old to use the services. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. When we become aware that personal information from a child under 13 has been collected without such child’s parent or guardian’s consent, we will use all reasonable efforts to delete such information from our database. If you believe that we might have collected any information from or about a child under the age of 13, please contact us at support@broadinfluence.com.</p>
<h4>California Residents </h4>
<p>If you are a California resident, you have the right to request and obtain from us a list of what personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year and the names and addresses of those third parties. Requests may be made only once a year and are free of charge.</p>
<h4>Changes to Privacy Policy </h4>
<p>Please review this Privacy Policy from time to time. We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove portions from this Privacy Policy at any time. Your continued use of the Service following the posting of any changes to this Privacy Policy means you accept such changes. If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy, we may provide you with additional forms of notice, as appropriate.</p>
<h4>Opt-Out Process </h4>
<p>To opt-out of any future promotional messages from us, you should send an unsubscribe request to us at support@broadinfluence.com.</p>
<p>We will process your request within a reasonable time after receipt. However, we are not responsible for removing your personally identifiable information from the lists of any third party who has previously been provided with your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy or your consent. </p>
<h4>Terms of Use</h4>
<p>This Privacy Policy, and the use of the Service, is subject to our Terms of Use. </p>
<h4>United States of America</h4>
<p>Our Service is maintained in the United States of America. By accessing the Service from a jurisdiction outside of the United States, you freely and specifically give us your consent to export your personally identifiable information from your local jurisdiction to our servers in the United States and to store and use such information in the United States as set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p>
